# Welcome

Welcome to the ROS CDK C# reference documents, where you can learn how to use the various resource classes and their functions.

The ROS CDK construction library is divided into different modules according to the granularity of the product, where each module contains the following:

- **Constructs** - All constructs of creatable resources, including constructs directly generated by ROS and high-level constructs.
- **Other Types** - All non-construct classes, interfaces, structs and enums that exist to support the constructs.
- **Datasource** - The constructs of all data sources, and the other types that support the constructs.
