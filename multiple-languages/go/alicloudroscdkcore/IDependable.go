// The presence of this interface indicates that an object has
// an `IDependableTrait` implementation.

// This interface can be used to take an (ordering) dependency on a set of
// constructs. An ordering dependency implies that the resources represented by
// those constructs are deployed before the resources depending ON them are
// deployed.
